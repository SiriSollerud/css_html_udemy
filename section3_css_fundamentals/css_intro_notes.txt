--resolving conflicting declarations--
priority:
  (declarations marked !important has highest priority- but bad style)
  (inline styles has higher priority- but bad style)
  1. ID (#) selector
  2. class (.) or pseudo-class (:) selector
  3. element selector (p, div, li, etc.)
  4. universal selector (*)
  --> if there are multiple 1, 2, or 3 then
      last selector in code applies

an element can have multiple classes
class = "copyright text"

--inheritance--
- most elements inherit text properties from parent
  --> inherited proprty is easily overwritten - they have low priority
